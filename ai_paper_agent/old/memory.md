## Event Log
- **[Innovation 1]**: Defined "KL-Regularized Aggregation" to address participation fairness in the Actor network. (File: `res/innov1.md`)
- **[Innovation 2]**: Defined "Multi-Objective Critic" to decouple performance and fairness evaluation using Vector Q-Learning. (File: `res/innov2.md`)
- **[Innovation 3]**: Defined "Graph Attention State Representation (GASR)" to capture high-order client relationships using GNNs. (File: `res/innov3.md`)
- **[Experiment]**: Finalized experimental design including Datasets (CIFAR-10, FEMNIST), Attack Scenarios (20% Label/Sign Flipping, ALIE), and Metrics (Acc, StdDev, Worst 10%). (File: `res/experiment.md`)

## Next Steps
- Begin drafting the paper sections based on the generated resource files.
- Execute the planned experiments.
